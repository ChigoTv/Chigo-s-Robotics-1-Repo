# Face Detection Using OpenCV

## Overview
This project utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time using a webcam. The application identifies and labels multiple faces, displaying bounding boxes around them. Users can exit the program by pressing the 'Q' key.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Multiple face tracking with automatic labeling (Person 1, Person 2, etc.).
- Pixel data extraction from detected faces.
- Ability to exit the application by pressing 'Q'.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- A webcam or external camera

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python face_detection.py
   ```
4. Press 'Q' to exit the application.

## Application in Robotics
This face detection system can be integrated into robotic configurations for:
- Human-robot interaction (HRI) systems to enable robots to recognize and respond to individuals.
- Security and surveillance applications where robots monitor human presence.
- Automated systems that require facial recognition for access control or assistance.
- Social robotics to enhance robot perception and engagement with humans.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning-based face recognition for more accurate detection.
- Integrate gesture recognition for interactive control.
- Implement infared detection
