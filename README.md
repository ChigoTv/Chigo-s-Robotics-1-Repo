# Running Python on Windows PowerShell

This guide will help you navigate using Python in **Windows PowerShell**, including setting up your environment, troubleshooting errors, and installing required packages.

## ðŸš€ **Basic PowerShell Navigation**
PowerShell operates with a directory structure similar to a command-line interface (CLI). Here are some essential commands:

```powershell
# Change directory (navigate to a folder)
cd Downloads

# List files in the current directory
ls

If you try to change into a directory that does not exist, you will see an error:

cd code
# cd : Cannot find path 'C:\Users\Chigo\Downloads\code' because it does not exist.

python --version
Python 3.13.1
