# Gesture-Controlled Robot using Webots and Mediapipe

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a multi-device robotic control system using **hand gestures**. A webcam-powered gesture recognition system on **Laptop A (Mac)** sends real-time commands to a simulated robot in **Webots** running on **Laptop B (Windows)** using a **Wi-Fi socket connection**. 

The system enables gesture-based movement:
- ✊ Fist → Move forward  
- ✋ Open palm → Move backward  
- ↩️ Tilt hand left → Turn left  
- ↪️ Tilt hand right → Turn right  

A fallback manual control system using **WASD keys** is also built in for robustness.
